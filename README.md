# 🎓 University Information Chatbot (C++ Project)

This is a simple menu-based chatbot built in C++ that provides information about a university (PAF-IAST). It reads data from local `.txt` files and displays details about departments, faculty, facilities, rules, and more.

## 🚀 Features
- Menu-driven console interface
- Reads information from external text files
- Generates a session summary report
- Uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

## 📄 How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the source code  
2. Make sure all `.txt` files (like `department.txt`, `rules.txt`, etc.) are in the same folder
